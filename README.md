# risk-game-group-13

I have created a new branch: "master-v2" and set it as base branch (or Trunk).
I have left the old master branch untouched incase I have missed some important files.

The new branch has a new organisation:
Each Assignment has a folder, and each part is a subFolder of the Assignment folder.
I have also deleted redundant files (I may have deleted too many that is why I have left all else untouched)
If you have any additions that you would like to make, please let me know ;)

So as to get the least errors possible, I **Strongly** recomend you create a **new clone** of master-v2 and delete your old branches.
I haven't done so myself in case any of you has important files on your respective branches.

I'm setting the branch as protected for the next few days to make sure that now stray merge is made (this means that when you make a pull request, it has to be peer reviewed before merging)
