#include "FortificationPhase.hpp"

//Provide a group of C++ classes that implement the fortification phase following the official rules of the game of Risk.
//In the fortification phase, the player is allowed to move a number of armies (X) from one of its countries (the source country) to one of its neighbors that it also owns (the target country).
//X must be in the range [1 to (number of armies on the source country - 1)].
//You must deliver a driver that demonstrates that
//1) only valid countries can be selected as source/target;
//2) only a valid number of armies can be moved;
//3) the right number of armies is effectively moved.
